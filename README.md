# RUSH-Incremental
Made for a project at my university. Now that the submission is complete I'm open sourcing it!

The project was creating a game using the C programming language that was taught over the semester. Of course, the first thought that sprang to mind was to create an incremental game! Unfortunately, I don't know how to make graphics in C (yet), but I managed to make a fully fledged incremental game with a prestige layer that autosaves!

## Inspiration
Sheet Music Boss's series of RUSH songs, a set of impossible piano pieces. The most popular of these is RUSH E: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qskm9MTz2V4

## How to play
1. Download the .exe file
2. (optional) You're probably gonna want to move the .exe out of your cluttered download folder to a known location on your computer
3. Run the program and play the game!

Warning: Moving the .exe and RushIncrementalSave.txt files to separate directories will cause you to lose your save. Make sure that the .exe and RushIncrementalSave.txt files are in the same directory.
