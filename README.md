# RUSH-Incremental
Made for a project at my university. Now that the submission is complete I'm open sourcing it!

The project was creating a game using the C programming language that was taught over the semester. Of course, the first thought that sprang to mind was to create an incremental game! Unfortunately, I don't know how to make graphics in C (yet), but I managed to make a fully fledged incremental game with a prestige layer that autosaves!

## Inspiration
Sheet Music Boss's series of RUSH songs, a set of impossible piano pieces. The most popular of these is RUSH E: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qskm9MTz2V4 (easter egg: my most liked YouTube comment is on this video, with over 10,000 likes!)

## How to play
1. Download the .exe file
2. (optional) You're probably gonna want to move the .exe out of your cluttered download folder to a known location on your computer
3. Run the program and play the game!

Warning: Moving the .exe and RushIncrementalSave.txt files to separate directories will cause you to lose your save. Make sure that the .exe and RushIncrementalSave.txt files are in the same directory.

## Changelog
11-15-2022: Started working on the game.<br />
11-16-2022: My computer's storage drive borked out of nowhere, causing me to lose all the code.<br />
11-28-2022: Got my computer working again<br />
11-29-2022: Started working on the game again<br />
12-5-2022: Game finished!<br />
12-13-2022 (v1.0): Game open-sourced and uploaded to GitHub!<br />
12-15-2022 (v1.0.1): Fixed a bug where RUSHing with very few notes gives more RUSH than with some notes (and RUSHing with no notes gave infinite RUSH lol)<br />
[Break from project]<br />
11-24-2025: Started working on an AI to find the optimal strategy to this game. This AI uses a 3-layer Neural Network to make its decision for each frame (note gain, upgrade purchase, or RUSH). This AI will be trained using a Genetic Algorithm rather than traditional optimizers.


Don't expect future updates to this game by me. It's a completed project. If you want more content, fork the code and make a mod!
